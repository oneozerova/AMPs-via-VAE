# AMPs-via-VAE
Conditional VAE for generation of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) sequences AMPs via VAE 

**Early-stage project repo:** building a clean AMP dataset + label extraction from APD6 (Gram+ / Gram−) to enable later VAE / conditional VAE generation.

> **Status:** Stage 0–1 (data + protocol).  
> **Not included yet:** model training, generation, or wet-lab validation.

## Project goal (early stage)
Create a **reproducible master dataset** of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) sequences and **multi-label activity tags** (at minimum: **anti-Gram+** and **anti-Gram−**) by merging:
1) an existing AMP sequence CSV (~8.2k rows), and  
2) activity annotations exported from the **APD6 web interface**.

This dataset will later support:
- training a proxy classifier (sequence → Gram+/Gram−),
- training a VAE / conditional VAE to generate novel AMP-like sequences.
